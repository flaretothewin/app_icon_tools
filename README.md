![Screenshot](preview.png)

## Description

This multiplatform app is powered by Flutter and was created for simple and intuitive preview and generation of (launcher/desktop) app icons, for the most popular operating systems. It doesn't contain tracking or any advertising and is available for free as an open-source. PRs, suggestions, translations, etc. ‚Äì are welcome!

### Features

Here are some of the unique features of this application:

* It creates icons not only for Android and iOS but for all platforms that Flutter supports (at the moment, the Linux platform from Flutter does not generate icons, but once the Flutter team fixes this problem, everything is ready).
* It can show icons in different shapes and with safety zone masks.
* It can show the parallax animation of adaptive Android icons (where you will find such functionality online :)?).
* It shows the icons as they would look on real devices.
* It generates icons not destructive way ‚Äî all you get is an archive, the contents of which you can check before you overwrite your files.
* It works natively on all platforms that Flutter supports.
* It will find you and show you the Issues that can cause you problems with displaying or App stores refusal.
* The project supports multiple languages, and you can easily add your own.
